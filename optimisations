To do:

Increase training time to inrease chance of malicious code being speculated.
Maybe find earlier stopping criteria - wait till variance of access time decreases below threshold and check if it is above the CPU threshold
Maybe look for cache misses instead of hits
Try to access multiple characters at a time
Increase speculation evaluation to give time for loads
Reduce the load times of the secret by maybe causing a prefetch
